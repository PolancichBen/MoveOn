# Welcome To MoveOn
MoveOn is a web application that assists the user in finding resources of a demographic area. The user would input a salary along with a location to start. The application would then return information of the area with the use of multiple external API's that are listed below. The user is then able to add more detailed information such as Bills, Insurances, and other debits or credits that they may want to add. When the user is finished adding the information they are then able to see if their current financial status would allow them to move to the area comfortably.

Below you will find the Tech Stack, and API's used.
